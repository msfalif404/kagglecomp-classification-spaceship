# kagglecomp-classification-spaceship
This repository contains codes for kaggle competitions. This competition uses classification techniques to predict whether a passenger is ejected or not.

I used techniques like XGBoost and tried hyperparameter tuning using Optuna. The code created is not very perfect considering that it has not been able to occupy the top 100 position on Kaggle.

Code improvisation can be done by pre-processing the data in more depth and tuning hyperparameters properly.
